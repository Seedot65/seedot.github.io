ABOUT KWOC:
KWOC is a five week long online programme aimed at helping those 
students who are new to Open Source Programming 
and also preparing them for events like GSOC.
SELECTING PROJECTS:
There was a large variety of projects available.I was used to a bit of Competive Programming 
and so I chose the project Competetive Programming ,which is a repository containing implementations 
of algoritms and problems in as many languages as possible,to help one refer whenever one is stuck on a problem.
ABOUT P.R.:
P.R. 1:
My first P.R. was on the implementation of Data Structure Tries
P.R. 2:
My second P.R. was on the the method of swapping two numbers without using any third variable,
just by using the bitwise operation XOR.
P.R. 3:
My third P.R. was on the problem of Matrix Chain Multiplication.The aim was to find the position of the parentheses
such that the multiplication of N no. of matrices require least number of scalar operations.The problem was solved
using Dynamic Programming

All the above were done using C++

P.R. 4:
My fourth P.R. was written in python and was a implementation of Count Sort

Conclusion:It was really constructive use of the winter holidays.I got to know about using Github
and contributed in a Project aimed at helping people facing trouble while programming
